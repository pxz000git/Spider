Following is a transcript of the video.　　纽约的皮肤科专家梅勒妮.格罗斯曼教授，解释了大家锻炼后经常会犯的错误，会如何影响皮肤。以下是文本。　　If you work out and then you leave the sweat on your skin, you can increase your chance of having acne. You are putting yourself at risk for infections. You can blog the pores, cloggin up of the hair follicles. It’s the moisture and the heat which increases your jock itch, athlete’s foot. I don’t think it’s a good idea to go out with your friends, or sit at a meal.　　如果锻炼完，汗液停留在你皮肤表面，将会增加你患粉刺的可能性。你将极有可能受到感染。你可能堵塞皮肤毛孔，或者头发毛囊。湿度和热度将会加重你的股藓以及足藓。我不认为这个时候和你的朋友们出去玩，或者吃顿饭是件好主意。　　There’s bacteria on your skin, and when you sweat you’re going to encourage the growth of that bacteria. I think you need to go to the shower and wash after you workout. And wash your clothing, I mean I’ve seen people come in and they have acne in areas underneath clothing and I say, "Well do you wash your clothes every time you go to the gym?" And they’re like "Ah, well I just leave my clothes in the locker."　　在你的皮肤上有各种真菌，当你流汗时，实际上，正在鼓励真菌的增长。当你锻炼完后，你要做的第一件事情，应该是洗一个澡。还有记得清洗衣物，我经常看到病人进来，在他衣服掩盖下有痤疮。我会问他，你去健身之后，会洗衣服吗？他们会回答，一般我就只是把衣服留在健身馆。　　No good. You really do have to wash your clothes and your skin after you workout. I’m asked sometimes "Is it necessary to remove that sweat as you’re working out?" And I think that’s really purely a comfort thing. I think as long as you shower and wash your face after you workout, you’re safe.　　这样子不好。在锻炼完，你需要清洗你的皮肤以及衣物。有些时候我会被问道，每次锻炼完，都擦汗，有必要吗？我认为这纯属安慰，我认为只要你锻炼完后，洗澡洗脸，你就是安全的。
